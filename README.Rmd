# mistats

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `mistats` is to provide shortcuts to some actions related to 
statistical analysis. In principle, the development of this package is only for
neatly wrapping some functions scripted by de author for himself, but the code
is now free in GitHub for use by anyone, if it helps. 

## Installation

You can install the development and unique version of `mistats` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("migfejo/mistats")
```
